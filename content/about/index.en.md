{{< admonition type=quote title="老子《道德经 二十四章》" open=true >}}
企者不立﹔跨者不行﹔

自见者不明﹔自是者不彰﹔

自伐者无功﹔自矜者不长。

其在道也，曰：余食赘形。

物或恶之，故有道者不处。
{{< /admonition >}}

My blog has moved too many times, and now this is yet another new beginning. Although my blog is still called "Untitled," some things have changed. As the saying goes, "He who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm" (企者不立) – and so, this new beginning is about breaking old habits.

When we got married, my blog was filled with posts about my wife and our wedding. Now, our happiness doesn't need to be displayed for anyone; all that matters is that we continue to love each other. And I truly love my Jiang.

Why I call my wife "Jiangjiang" is a secret. But one thing isn't a secret: I love the name, and she does too. While I've moved my blog, my Jiangjiang has also started a new life as a [Bilibili UP (creator)](https://space.bilibili.com/4285639#/) . Although her work involves translation, every time I see her dedication and effort, my admiration for her grows even stronger. So, if you enjoy hip-hop music, funny videos, or Cardi B, then you might want to consider following her channel!

While I've built this blog little by little myself, I've also received a lot of help. Kind individuals who write tutorials and guides, as well as the unsung heroes who silently update templates and documentation – they've all helped me in various ways. I hope these positive contributions continue to grow, and that everyone can find the help they need online.

All in all, it's another new beginning, and another journey full of unknowns.
